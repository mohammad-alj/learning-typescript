### Fundamentals

when assigning a variable with a value, the typescript compiler will assume the type
based on the value, for instance we declare 'age' and set it to 14 typescript will automatically
detect that this is a number so there is no need to annotate the 'age' with type 'number'

## the any type
the any type can hold any values, also its a very bad practice because the whole point of typescript
is to add types
